"""tyui — Norton Commander/mc-style terminal shell on top of tyui.windowing.

Phase 1: skeleton only. Composes MenuBar + Desktop + CommandLine + StatusBar
and mounts an initial set of windows depending on the launch mode:

    fm     -> two FilePanel windows tiled in the upper area (default)
    editor -> a placeholder editor window maximized; panels mounted hidden
    cli    -> a placeholder agent window maximized; panels mounted hidden

Later phases will: wire commands, file ops, real editor/agent content, etc.
