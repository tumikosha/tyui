"""Recursive file search ("Find file") — pure logic, no UI.

Mirrors the conventions of ``tyui.fm.actions``:

- Synchronous; the App layer wraps :func:`walk` in ``run_worker(thread=True)``.
- Errors during traversal (PermissionError, vanished entries, unreadable
  symlinks) are swallowed silently — best-effort partial output.
- Honours an optional ``cancel_event`` (``threading.Event``) so the user
  can interrupt a long search; on cancel, :func:`walk` returns
  ``FindResult(..., cancelled=True)`` with whatever was found so far.
- Reports progress via callbacks. ``on_progress`` is called **once per
  directory** (not per file) so :class:`Application.call_from_thread` is
  not flooded when scanning trees with millions of entries.
