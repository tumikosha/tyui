"""Key Probe — a diagnostic window that echoes every keypress Textual decodes.

Some keys (notably Ctrl+digit and Alt+letter) never reach the app on macOS
Terminal.app / iTerm2 because the terminal emits no escape sequence for them.
The Key Probe is the in-app way to check what *does* arrive: it captures every
``Key`` event, shows the most recent one large, and keeps a scrolling log of
the raw decode (``key`` / ``character`` / ``aliases``).

The window is closed the normal way (its close box, or Esc / the Windows menu);
``on_key`` deliberately does NOT call ``event.stop()`` for Esc/F10 so the user
can still bail out via the app-level bindings.
