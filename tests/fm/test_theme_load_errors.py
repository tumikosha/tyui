"""Theme load failures must never crash or freeze the shell.

A malformed theme file still shows up in ``list_themes()`` (the glob finds the
file) and therefore in the Options menu. Selecting it routes through
``_apply_theme`` -> ``Desktop.set_theme`` -> ``theme_registry.get`` which raises
``ThemeLoadError``. If that escapes the menu-click handler the UI freezes, so
``_apply_theme`` must swallow it, keep the current theme, and surface the error.
