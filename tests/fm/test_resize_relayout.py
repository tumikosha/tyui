"""Terminal-resize relayout regression tests.

Covers two fixes:

1. Maximized windows must keep filling the desktop on resize (the Desktop's
   clamp only shrinks, never grows — so without a re-fill they got stuck at
   the old size when the terminal was enlarged).
2. In non-fm launch modes (``we``/``editor``/``cli``) ``App.on_resize`` now
   re-tiles panels and refills cascade editors. Previously it was gated to
   fm only, so on resize the file panels overlapped on shrink and nothing
   grew on enlarge.
